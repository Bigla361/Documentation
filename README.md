# Documentation
  Unofficial ROBLOX Web API documentation.

# What's different?
  Internal APIs (previously undocumented to the public)<br/>
  Backend APIs (previously completely undocumented, even to ROBLOX employees)<br/>
  index.html has worse web design (im sorry im sorry)<br/>
  
# How to Use?
  Get the browser extension 'CORS Unblock' (you won't have to do this for long)<br/>
  Press the button for the extension to use APIs here. <br/>
  Turn it off to go on normal ROBLOX.<br/>
